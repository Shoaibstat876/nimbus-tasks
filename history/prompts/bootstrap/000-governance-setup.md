## Prompt

Initialize governance and spec-driven development scaffolding for the Todo List project.

- 🧪 Tests: Not applicable
- 📁 Files: `.specify/` folder added
- 🔁 Next prompts: Create Todo feature specification
- 🧠 Reflection: Stop early, lock foundation before feature work

- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Generate first feature spec

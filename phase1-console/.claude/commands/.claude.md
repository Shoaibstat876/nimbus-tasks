# Nimbus Tasks Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from feature plans. Last updated: 2025-12-27

## Active Technologies

- TypeScript + Next.js (App Router) + React (Nimbus Tasks monorepo)
- Local persistence: browser localStorage (Todo MVP)

## Project Structure

```text
apps/
  web/
    src/
      app/
      features/
packages/
  ui/
specs/
  [###-feature]/
    spec.md
    plan.md
    research.md
    data-model.md
    quickstart.md
    contracts/
    tasks.md
.history/
.specify/

## Commands 
# Repo
git status
git diff
git log --oneline -5

# Web app (typical)
cd apps/web
npm run dev
npm run lint
npm test

## Code Style

TypeScript/React: keep components small, typed props, predictable state updates

Prefer pure functions for “logic” (hooks/stores) and keep UI components presentation-first

No hidden side effects: storage updates are explicit and validated

Keep error strings user-friendly; keep internal errors in dev logs only

Todo MVP: CRUD + toggle + filter + persistence (web)

<!-- MANUAL ADDITIONS START -->
Non-Negotiable Workflow (Nimbus)

Specs first. If something is wrong, fix the spec/plan, then regenerate/implement.

Keep one evolving app through phases (don’t fork into multiple apps).

Don’t move to the next level until the checklist gate passes (YES/DONE only).

Console UI is I/O only; logic lives in skills/modules.

<!-- MANUAL ADDITIONS END -->


### Why this is the “right amount”
- It matches what you *actually* have now: `apps/web` + `packages/ui` + `specs/`.
- It doesn’t fight your automation scripts: when `plan.md` exists, your `update-agent-context.ps1` can keep appending tech entries later.

## How to use your planning workflow (your last pasted `/sp.plan` command)

When you’re on your feature branch:

```powershell
# 1) Setup plan file under current feature
.specify/scripts/powershell/setup-plan.ps1 -Json

# 2) Fill plan.md (you do this via /sp.plan flow)
# 3) Then update Claude context from plan.md
.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType claude

If plan.md has the “Technical Context” fields filled like:

Language/Version

Primary Dependencies

Storage

Project Type

…then your agent updater will correctly populate the “Active Technologies” section automatically.

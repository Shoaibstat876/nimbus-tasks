## Law 1: No Vibe Coding
- The AI shall never "guess" a feature. 
- If the .specify file or ADR is missing a detail, the AI MUST ask for a decision instead of inventing a solution.

## Law 2: The Gate Protocol
- No code is considered "finished" until Evidence (logs/screenshots) is provided.
- The AI must reject requests to "skip" a gate.

## Law 3: Architectural Purity
- Strictly follow the /api prefix and Owner-only access rules. 
- Any code generated without `user_id` filtering is a critical failure.

## Law 4: Communication Style
- Be concise, technical, and rigorous. 
- No fluff. Focus on the Spec, the Gate, and the Evidence.
